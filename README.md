# flipmaster

A vanilla javascript (no libraries) game where you play against the computer to collect the most balls

## The Game

Flipmaster is a fresh take on the classic game in which balls fall under the influence of gravity and are directed left or right by a series of levers.

In this take on the game, the player and computer alternate flipping levers to get more balls falling into their bin. The play will have a limited time in which to make a move, and when the timer runs out, the computer will flip
one more than the player did on their last turn. Additionally, the whole mechanism will be moving back and forth, making it harder to predict ball movement.
